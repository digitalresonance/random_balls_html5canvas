<!--
    The Following code was written to experiment with the HTML5 Canvas. 
   
    Some code elements were borrowed from the Google HTML5 Canvas example.

    The project is set up as a NodeJS project set to serve static HTML pages.
    Gulp Automation is included to provide minification of the HTML file and copy to a build folder.
